2 Major ADTs
   - binary tree: is a position-oriented ADT, but it is not linear. Meaning that you will not reference items in a binary tree by its using a position number.


   - binary search tree: A value-oriented ADT. Although a binary search tree is also not linear, it has operations similar to those of a sorted list, which is linear. 

Nodes in the tree are what contain the data. The lines between the nodes are called edges. All the trees are "hierarchical" meaning that there is a parent-child relationship between the nodes in the tree. Nodes that are children of the same parents are known as siblings. 
Each node in the tree has at most one parent, and exactly one node known as a root of the tree and it has no parent. A node that does not have a child is called a leaf of a tree.

Kinds of trees:
   -A binary tree has the restriction that every node has at most two children.
A binary tree is a set T of nodes that is either empty or partitioned into disjoint subsets. 
The binary tree has two children which are known as the left and right subtree of Root 

   -A binary search tree is in a sense sorted according to its values. The left nodes are less then the root and the right child nodes are greater than the root.
